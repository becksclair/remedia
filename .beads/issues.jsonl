{"id":"remedia-0md","title":"Fix Rust test binary STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND error","description":"Rust test suite fails with STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND (0xc0000139) when running 'cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml'. The test binary (remedia_lib-*.exe) exits abnormally before tests can run. This may indicate a missing DLL dependency, corrupted build artifacts, or a Windows-specific runtime issue.","notes":"Root cause: Known Tauri bug (#13954, #13419) - the common-controls-v6 default feature causes STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND on Windows when running cargo test. Workaround: Disable default features in Cargo.toml and explicitly enable only required features: tauri = { version = \"2.9.3\", default-features = false, features = [\"wry\", \"compression\", \"devtools\", \"unstable\"] }","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-10T14:51:27.7815732+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-10T22:20:15.6202481+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-10T22:20:15.6202481+01:00"}
{"id":"remedia-aea","title":"Fix CustomTitleBar test failure with mocked quit rejection","description":"CustomTitleBar.test.tsx test 'should fallback to window.close if quit fails in WSL2' fails because the mocked quit rejection (mockQuit.mockRejectedValue) is not being caught properly. The error 'Quit failed' is surfacing instead of being handled by the fallback logic.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-10T14:51:26.8837443+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-10T21:55:15.3910908+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-10T21:55:15.3910908+01:00"}
{"id":"remedia-v80","title":"Fix Playwright e2e test configuration errors","description":"Playwright e2e tests (e2e/app.spec.ts, e2e/real-download.spec.ts) fail with error: 'Playwright Test did not expect test.describe() to be called here'. This suggests a configuration issue - either test.describe() is being called in a config file, imported by config, or there are duplicate @playwright/test versions.","notes":"Root cause: Bun has compatibility issues with Playwright (segfault). Fix: Use npx instead of bunx in package.json scripts. Tests work with 'npx playwright test' - first 3 tests pass, others fail due to dev server not running (expected in CI without webserver). The original 'test.describe() called in config' error is now resolved.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-10T14:51:25.9869002+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-10T22:20:11.7161551+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-10T22:20:11.7161551+01:00"}
